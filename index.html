        <p>Hello, My name is Daniel Lobo, I am 26 years old and I am from São Paulo, Brazil. I married three years ago and my daughter has just born less than a month ago. I'm really happy and excited with this new journey of my life, and I know that the families can be together forever, it's not an easy task, but it's possible. I've some hobbies like sports in general, but I'm really good playing soccer and table tennis, I also like to play games and dance with my wife, we can dance pretty well together. I served as a full-time missionary six years ago on Brazil Goiania Mission, and it was an incredible time to growth and learn who I want to be and how I can do it.</p>
